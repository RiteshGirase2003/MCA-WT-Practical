    "# What is a Cursor?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A cursor in MongoDB (and in databases generally) is a mechanism that allows you to iterate over a set of documents or records returned by a query, one document at a time. Instead of loading all documents in memory at once, a cursor helps manage large datasets by fetching documents as you process them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "# Purpose of a Cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient Data Handling: Instead of loading all records into memory, a cursor lets you fetch records incrementally, saving memory and resources.\n",
    "# Controlled Iteration: Cursors allow you to process each document one by one, making it possible to apply processing logic or transformations to each document before moving to the next.\n",
    "# Better Performance: Cursors improve performance when working with large data by avoiding bulk fetching of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to Use a Cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "# When processing a large number of records from a database.\n",
    "# When you need to apply some logic to each document individually.\n",
    "# When you want to optimize memory usage by loading documents only as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation of Cursor Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "# departments_cursor = departments_collection.find(): This creates a cursor to iterate through each department document.\n",
    "# for department in departments_cursor:: Here, we use the cursor to access each department one by one.\n",
    "# employees_cursor = employees_collection.find({'department_id': department['_id']}): For each department, we create a new cursor to retrieve associated employees based on the department_id.\n",
    "# for employee in employees_cursor:: We use a nested cursor to iterate through each employee belonging to the current department.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use a Cursor?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient fetching of records without loading everything at once.\n",
    "# Controlled access to each document, letting us process departments and employees independently.\n",
    "# Reduced memory usage, as only the required documents are fetched when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Cases for Cursors\n",
    "\n",
    "# Large Dataset Processing: When working with large collections, cursors prevent memory overload by fetching documents only when needed.\n",
    "# Data Transformation: Cursors allow for real-time data processing, enabling transformations on each document during iteration.\n",
    "# Pagination: Cursors are often used to implement pagination by limiting the number of documents fetched at a time.\n",
